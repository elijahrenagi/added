    <p>Hi ALL, I am a husband to my beautiful wife, and have a handsome son. I am from Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby. I come from a village in my country called Makirupu.
    The weather in Port Moresby is always hot and sunny.
    </p>
    <p>I am currently a student of BYUI taking up my first year in Web Development. I thank
    the Lord for such a blessing he's given to me to continue my education.
